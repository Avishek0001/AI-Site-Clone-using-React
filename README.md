# AI Site Clone

This is a fully responsive Frontend project built using React + Vite . The project is an AI website that will answer all your doubts and needs accordingly. 
I have used free Google Gemini API to get the AI part.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
